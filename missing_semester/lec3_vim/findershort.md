When I go to the URL bar on chrome, there seem to be a lot of commands you can do. why does this exist. 
ctrl-E: goes to end of line
ctrl-T: swaps the character to the cursor's left and right
ctrl-Y: pastes from pasteboard
ctrl-O: beeps, but still moves the cursor backwards by one
ctrl-P: moves to front of line on searchbar, goes to end on chrome search bar
ctrl-A: goes to front of line
ctrl-D: deletes single character before cursor
ctrl-F: moves cursor forward
ctrl-H: deletes after cursor
ctrl-K: deletes everything after
ctrl-V: goes to end. stays there.
ctrl-B: moves cursor backwards
ctrl-N: moves to end or back to original
