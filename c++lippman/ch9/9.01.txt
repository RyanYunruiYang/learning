Exercise 9.1:
Which is th emost appropriate -- a vector, a deque, or a list -- for the
following programming tasks? Explain the rationale for your choice. If there
is no reason to prefer one or another container, explain why not.

(a) Read a fixed number of words, inserting them into the container
alphabetically as they are entered. We'll see in the next chapter that
associative containers are better suited to this problem.

(b) Read an unknown number of words. Always insert new words at the back.
Remove the next value from the front. 

(c) Read an unknown number of integers from a file. Sort the numbers and then
print them to standard output. 

Solution:

(a). list, to insert into middle.

(b). deque, for both front/back operations.

(c). vector, as there are no special requirement.s
