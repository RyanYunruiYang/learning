Exercise 9.9: What is the difference between the begin and cbegin functions?

Solution: begin() returns a iterator, and cbegin() returns a const_iterator type.

It is worth noting that begin() is overloaded, so it too will return a const_iterator
if the member is const. Thus, the difference arises only in the case when the 
input member is not const, in which case .cbegin() will force it to be const.
