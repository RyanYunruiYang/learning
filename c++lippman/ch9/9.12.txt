Exercise 9.12: 
Explain the differences between the constructor that takes a container to copy
and the constructor that takes two iterators.

Solution: The difference is that the constructor that takes a container to copy
needs to take in a container with the same container type and element type;

this is different from the iterator, which is significantly more flexible, 
where the container types can differ as the iterator is agnostic to this,
and the element types can differ as long as they are convertible.
