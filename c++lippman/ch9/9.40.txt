Exercise 9.40: If the program in the previous exercise reads 256 words, what is
its likely capacity after it is resized? What if it reads 512? 1,000? 1,048?

Answer:
- inputsize=256 -> size=384, capacity=1024
- inputsize=512 -> size=768, capacity=1024
- inputsize=1000 -> size=1500, capacity>=1500 (2000 on my machine)
- inputsize=1048 -> size=1572, capacity>=1572 (2048 on my machine)
