Exercise 18.20: In the following code, determine which function, if any,
matches the call to compute. List the candidate and viable functions. What type
conversions, if any, are applied to the argument to match the parameter in each
viable function?

	namespace primerLib {
		void compute();
		void compute(const void *);
	}
	using primerLib::compute;
	void compute(int);
	void compute(double, double = 3.4);
	void compute(char*, char* = 0);
	void f()
	{
		compute(0);
	}

What would happen if the using declaration were located in main before the call
to compute? Answer the same questions as before.

Answer: 

Candidate functions: compute(), compute(const void *), compute(int), compute(double, double=3.4), compute(char*, char* = 0)
Viable: compute(const void *), compute(int), compute(double, double=3.4), compute(char*, char* = 0)
Chosen: compute(int) because it is an exact match.
