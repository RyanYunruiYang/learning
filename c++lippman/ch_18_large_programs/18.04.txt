Exercise 18.4: Looking ahead to the inheritance hierarchy in Figure 18.1 (p.
783), ex- plain whatâ€™s wrong with the following try block. Correct it.

	try {
	// use of the C++ standard library
	} catch(exception) {
	// ...
	} catch(const runtime_error &re) {
	// ...
	} catch(overflow_error eobj) { /* ... */ }


Answer: The first catch, with exception, is too general and will capture anything
that would have gone to const runtime_error &re or overflow_error.

To fix, this rearrange to: 
try {

} catch(overflow_error eobj) {
    
} catch(const runtime_error &re) {

} catch (exception) {
    
}
