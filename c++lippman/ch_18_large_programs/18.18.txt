Exercise 18.18: Given the following typical definition of swap ยง 13.3 (p. 517),
determine which version of swap is used if mem1 is a string. What if mem1 is an
int? Explain how name lookup works in both cases.

	void swap(T v1, T v2)
	{
		using std::swap;
		swap(v1.mem1, v2.mem1);
		// swap remaining members of type T
	}

Answer:
- if mem1 is a string, since swap apparently has a specialized template for string, the std version will be called 
- if mem1 is an int, the swap function will be called, which will swap the values of the two ints
