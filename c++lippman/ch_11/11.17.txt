Exercise 11.17: Assuming c is a multiset of strings and v is a vector of
strings, explain the following calls. Indicate whether each call is legal:
    copy(v.begin(), v.end(), inserter(c, c.end()));
    copy(v.begin(), v.end(), back_inserter(c));
    copy(c.begin(), c.end(), inserter(v, v.end()));
    copy(c.begin(), c.end(), back_inserter(v));
