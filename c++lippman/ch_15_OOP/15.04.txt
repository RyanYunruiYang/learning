Exercise 15.4: Which of the following declarations, if any, are incorrect?
Explain why.

	class Base { ... };
	(a) class Derived : public Derived { ... };
	(b) class Derived : private Base { ... };
	(c) class Derived : public Base;


(a) Incorrect. Classes cannot derive from themselves.
(b) Fuzzy. Valid, but it's actually a definition not a declaration. But otherwise valid.
(c) Incorrect. Declarations do not contain derivation lists.
