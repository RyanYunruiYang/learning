Exercise 15.24: What kinds of classes need a virtual destructor? What
operations must a virtual destructor perform?

Answer: Base classes should include a virtual destructor in order for
the destructor to be dynamic type aware.

The virtual destructor will need to be overridden and reimplemented
to delete dynamic memory on the heap if it is used.
