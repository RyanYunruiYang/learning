Exercise 13.4: Assuming Point is a class type with a public copy constructor,
identify each use of the copy constructor in this program fragment:

	Point global;
	Point foo_bar(Point arg)
	{
		Point local = arg, *heap = new Point(global);
		*heap = local;
		Point pa[ 4 ] = { local, *heap };
		return *heap;
	}

Answer: 
- 1: Point arg being passed in
- 2: Point local = arg
- 3: creating Point *heap = new Point(global);
- 4&5: pa[0]=local and pa[1]=*heap 
- 6: returning
