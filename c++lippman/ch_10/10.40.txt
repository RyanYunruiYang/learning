Exercise 10.40: What kinds of iterators do you think copy requires? What about
reverse or unique?

Answer:
- copy: input iterator for src, output iterator for dst
- reverse: bidirectional iterator (even though in reverse implementations, first only needs ++ and last only needs --)
- unique: forward iterator
