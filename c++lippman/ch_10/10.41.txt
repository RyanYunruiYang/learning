Exercise 10.41: Based only on the algorithm and argument names, describe the
operation that the each of the following library algorithms performs:

	replace(beg, end, old_val, new_val);
	replace_if(beg, end, pred, new_val);
	replace_copy(beg, end, dest, old_val, new_val);
	replace_copy_if(beg, end, dest, pred, new_val);


Answer:
- replace: searches in [beg,end) for all instances of old_val, and replaces them with new_val
- replace_if: test in [beg,end) for satisfiers of pred, and replaces them with new_val
- replace_copy: does replace, but writes to dest
- replace_copy_if: does replace_if, but writes to dest
