Exercise 16.46: Explain this loop from StrVec::reallocate in ยง 13.5 (p. 530):

	for (size_t i = 0; i != size(); ++i)
		alloc.construct(dest++, std::move(*elem++));

Answer:
*elem++ returns an lvalue pointing to the original value of elem before the postfix increment. 
this is converted to an rvalue reference by std::move, which is then used to construct.
