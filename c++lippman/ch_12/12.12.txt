Exercise 12.12: Using the declarations of p and sp explain each of the
following calls to process. If the call is legal, explain what it does. If the
call is illegal, explain why:

	auto p = new int();
	auto sp = make_shared<int>();
	(a) process(sp);
	(b) process(new int());
	(c) process(p);
	(d) process(shared_ptr<int>(p));

Answer:

    (a) legal
    (b) illegal, converting raw pointer to shared_ptr
    (c) illegal, converting raw pointer to shared_ptr
    (d) legal, but the memory at p will be deleted.
