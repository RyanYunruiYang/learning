Exercise 14.4: Explain how to decide whether the following should be class members:
(a) % (b) %= (c) ++ (d) -> (e) << (f) && (g) == (h) ()


(a) % should be a nonmember (symmetric)
(b) %= should be a member 
(c) ++ should be a member 
(d) -> should be a member 
(e) << should be a nonmember (pg. 557)
(f) && should not be overloaded
(g) == should be a nonmember
(h) () should be a member
