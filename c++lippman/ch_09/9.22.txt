Exercise 9.22: Assuming iv is a vector of ints, what is wrong with the following
program? How might you correct the problem(s)?

vector<int>::iterator iter = iv.begin(), mid = iv.begin() + iv.size()/2;

while (iter != mid)
    if (*iter == some_val)
        iv.insert(iter, 2 * some_val);


Solution: 
- unclear if you can do addition on iterators
- will be infinite loop
